      <p>1. Viet’s Personal Information: My name is Nguyen Manh Quoc Viet and my student number is s3759306. I am Vietnamese, and I was born in Hanoi, Vietnam with my parents and my brother, but when they moved to Moscow, Russia, I was raised there, because their Vietnamese friends were living in Moscow. I didn’t have any education in Moscow, until me and my family went back to Vietnam, but in a different city, which was Ho Chi Minh city in 2004. In this city, I have enrolled in various random English schools to study English language, as well as enrolled in Russian school, in which I studied Russian language, as well as mathematics, English, Russian literature and Arts. After studying in Russian school, I was enrolled in Asia Pacific College School, but I didn’t like it there, since I don’t studied Vietnamese much in Vietnamese classes, because I have poor Vietnamese speaking skills. After that, I enrolled in Australian International School (AIS) in years 8 to 13, skipping year 7, since I have studied English at home with my English tutor. Finally, I have enrolled at RMIT University Vietnam. At first, I choose the engineering programs over IT programs, but after I have realized that the engineering programs were too difficult for me, I have switched to study IT programs, in which I became a Bachelor of IT. My hobby is playing piano when I have free time, because playing video games could waste my time and my energy, in which I could become more tired and want to sleep. In addition, they could fill my mind with video games, in which I will have less concentration when doing homework. I used to play video games, but now I stopped playing, because I have other important things to do and it destroys my restful sleep time. My interests in IT is that there are many devices that has unique features, such as smartphone’s touch screen device that allows users to touch any apps by using their fingers, the motion sensors at home could automatically turn on the lights when the person came home, a computers is able to read files when the disk has been inserted into it and internet offers many websites worldwide through wi-fi. My interest and experience in IT starts when I started using computer when I was a child and I could see many websites coming from the internet when I search them on Google and when I click their links in Google. In addition, there are many errors encountered when I opened a file that requires a suitable software to run it smoothly, such as when installing a Python and when inputting a code in PyCharm Community, in which they require updating my laptop’s software through sending my laptop to the computer engineers, so that they could update its software. </p>

      <p>2. Thinh’s Personal Information: My name is Vu Gia Thinh and my student number is s3820373. I was born in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam on 3rd May 2000 and my email is s3820373@rmit.edu.vn. If I have to say, I have a lot of hobbies. Playing games, soccer, reading books, watching movies, etc. I can also play musical instruments: guitar and electronic keyboard, but I am more confident on my guitar skills, and I usually play it in my free time. I enjoy playing games the most, I believe this is the most common mean of entertainment for a lot of people. Related to that, there is something you may find interesting about me, and that is my passion for the game League of Legends (LOL). Like most teenagers in Vietnam, I like this game a lot, though I don't have the skills to conquer it, but I like to watch professional players perform in domestic as well as international tournaments. I try to analyze their gameplays and the strategies they use when I watch them, and I can successfully read the moves. So, if things go sideways with my career in the future, an e-sports coach or an e-sports analyst is my back-up plan. My hard works in secondary school got me to this place, Le Hong Phong High School for the Gifted, HCMC, Vietnam, one of the best high schools in Ho Chi Minh City. It is a huge honor to be a student of this school, I learnt a lot throughout 3 years (2015 – 2018). I have become fully equipped and well prepared as a grown-up person thanks to its quality education. I had plenty of beautiful memories there, and I always want to turn back to the old days being a high school student. I just miss this school so much! In 2018 - 2019 after finishing high school, I managed to earn a scholarship at Kent Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia and decided to study abroad. I spent nearly a year in Australia and then there was an incident happened to my family, I decided to come back home and transfer my student record along with me to Vietnam to be able to continue my bachelor’s degree. In 2019, RMIT University Vietnam accepted the results of my study in Australia and some subjects were exempted. This is the place where I continue my bachelor’s degree and I am looking forward to the days coming at this school! My interest in IT is that I want to pursue IT career because I want to know everything, I do not want to be outdated because of my lack in knowledge. It annoys me when there is something that happens daily in our lives, but I cannot seem to understand it. Everyone can agree that information and knowledge are powerful tools to help us achieve anything in our lives. IT provides almost everything we need to know in this modern world. Therefore, data analytics is the field that I am most interested about. I like working with numbers, statistic and most importantly, the data. My interest and experiences in IT began in the past when I had access to computer since I was 4 or 5 years of age and I liked to mess around with my computer, I kept digging the files and look for anything I want on the Internet. With a big curiosity, I wondered what makes the computer and the Internet, who controls them and how do them work. I kept those questions along with me until I was older and be able to understand the IT world. The definition of IT jobs only came to my mind 3 years ago, at first, I did not take the thought seriously, but then, my uncle, who is working in an IT environment, encouraged me to follow the IT path. I took his advice, and now I am here. I choose to study RMIT, because I transferred my student record from Australia to Vietnam and RMIT is the most suitable place for me to continue the degree because it has the same education system from Australia. More importantly, studying in RMIT allows me to participate in an international environment, and its facility and infrastructure are perfect to assist student in their study or to receive support from dedicated, caring staffs. I just feel that RMIT is the best place for me. During Introduction to Information Technology, I expect to learn basic concepts of all IT fields, therefore, I can decide my career path in the future. Learning how to fully exploit the capabilities of tools and apps in order to perfect the task is crucial. I am hoping to improve my communication and presentation skills in the near future, it really benefits me when I start working in a professional environment. Also, the ability to participate, and cooperate with every member within a team is a must-have skill when I left RMIT.</p>

      <p>Personal Profiles:</p>
    </body>
  
    <body>
      <p>1. Viet’s Personal Profile: The results I got from 16Personalities, which was a Myers-Briggs test is that my personality type is Defender, in which I have introversion, sensing, feeling, judging, as well as thinking traits (ISFJ-T). This means that I am caring, helpful and organized person, in which I do the things I have planned in an organized way, as well as I am helping other people to fix their mistakes if they have done not right. Not only that, but I am caring to other people as I help them do their work. The results I got from TestMyCreativity website is that I have higher complexity, medium abstraction and boldness, low curiosity and perspective and lower persistence and paradox. This means that I have higher capability to carry lots of information, recreate them so that they could make sense even more and manage the relationships between them. Not only that, but I also have the capability to summarize various concepts from their original ideas. The results I got from Personality Max website is that I have higher strength of visual learning than auditory and kinesthetic learning. This means that I am good at remembering people’s faces after I have met them, although I sometimes forget their faces, because I haven’t met them again for a long time. In addition, I also could picture the things in my mind, in which when I see the objects and symbols many times, the pictures of them will form in my mind. These results could influence my behavior in a team, in which I was caring, selfless, organized and helpful person who plans which part each group member could do and when they are finished, they combine the parts together to complete a group work project. When doing the group work project, I read instructions carefully, so that I could know what to do and I have a good visual learning, in which I could see visual information clearly and precise, such as charts, graphs and diagrams. To take this into account when forming a team, I could ask them which group work project part that my group members could do and once they are finished, me and my group members will merge them together to make a complete group work project. In addition, me and my group members must read the instructions carefully and when seeing visual information, they need to see clearly their details and statistics, so that their information could be stored in our minds for paraphrasing them to be clearer. Not only that, but me and my group members must help each other when facing difficult problems and work together as a group, so that we could overcome these types of problems.</p>

      <p>2. Thinh's Personal Profile: After taking these tests (Myers-Briggs Test, Learning Style Test and Big Five Personality Test), I was not surprised at all because I kind of figured out who am I already, but I did find them interesting for so many new aspects that I may own. The tests help me feel more certain about myself so I can confidently develop as planned. I am an observer, within a team, besides focusing on my part, I would always be watching what my teammates do. If it is about something I know or have a relatively deep knowledge of, I will pay my attention on their works and contribute my thoughts to them. And if I have no idea about the topic, I will just simply watch and learn. I only become a team leader when I feel comfortable with the task given, my motto is let the most suitable one handle the problem, proficiency is my first priority. I am very open to ideas, and I only conduct if the benefits outweigh risks, I am not a risk taker. I want to play safe and steady, if I have to say, within a team, I would be the team anchor to keep my mates on their toes. I feel more comfortable being in a team with devoted members, it does not have to be consisted of talented individuals, I want to cooperate with people who eager to invest their time for the work, they will get better eventually. Within a team, I can undertake any given task, even if I have to learn and improvise to accomplish the goal. I would do anything for my team because the team's benefits are my highest priority.</p>

      <p>Ideal Jobs:</p>
    </body>
    
    <body>
      <p>1. Viet’s Ideal Job: AI Engineer is a job that involves describing and using the right Artificial Intelligence or cognitive computing technologies in order to fix the problems of the customers’ devices when they are not working and making AI recipes for development of the new technologies, as well as understanding the business problems, contemporary technologies’ challenges and areas of applying AI technologies. In addition, AI Engineer also involves making machine learning models and prototype device applications, AI platforms and AI projects by using made AI recipes. What makes this job appeals to me is that in the past, I have used both computers and phones, but haven’t checked out what are their unique features in them and how they were made, such as smartphone’s touch screen device, laptop’s motion sensor mouse, contemporary devices’ voice commands and search, smartphone’s keyboard that allows users to swipe letters into words through the use of a finger, laptop’s face recognition for automatic log in and contemporary devices’ changeable screen through tilting them into landscape form or into tablet form. In order to be an AI Engineer, I need to have at least 0.5 years of learning how to use one of Java, C, C++ or Python programming languages, study web application development as well as building API driven interface development. For the programming languages, I need to learn how us C++ for 4 years, Java for 2 years, Swift, C# .NET, SQL, JavaScript and HTML/CSS. The technologies I need to install include API, MVC, RealmSwift, Alamofire, Google Firebase, Java Web, Swing, Tomcat Web Server, JSTL, Struts and Json. In addition, I also need to install Visual Studio, Microsoft SQL Server, NetBeans, XCode, Postman, Git and Source Tree. I currently have typing skills, but I have poor coding skills, because I have focused too much on Engineering programs than IT programs when I am studying at RMIT University Vietnam and I study a little bit of IT when I was in AIS School, in which I have little IT skills. I also have mathematical skills, because I have studied mathematics at high school. I got a certificate in AIS School when I have finished Year 13 through successfully competing at least 3 courses. I have successfully completed English, Mathematical Studies and Psychology. I have studied algorithms and strings in Introduction to Programming and made strings and algorithms, but they don’t work properly, as I have poor coding skills, since I was still new to the IT community in RMIT University Vietnam. I will learn how to code properly and use various programming languages through studying Programming 1 in order to improve my coding skills, as well as learning how to make algorithms and strings in order to make them work properly.</p>

      <p>2. Thinh's Ideal Job: I want to be a Data Analyst in the near future, then after years of experience, Data Scientist is my final goal. The most interesting part of this job for me is that the worker has to work with raw information, numbers and turns them into something meaningful for business organizations. Frankly speaking, the purpose of this job is selling the (appropriate) information for anyone who needs them. Personally, I believe this job requires traits from employees to best-suited for qualifications. Firstly, is patience, this is extremely important because you have to spend most of your time to gather information, filter, and make use of them. For example, you want to build a model which can predict the price of houses or apartments, you will have to gather houses data from various sources, and each source saves data in different structures, so eventually you will have to unify them in a single, mutual structure. Furthermore, the data needed filtering so that the final results are meaningful, selected information. Secondly, the job requires excellent communication skill because you have to work with different departments efficiently, such as the business teams, engineer teams, etc. And finally, it does matter that the person is fascinated by finding and trying new things to keep him/her up to date. A data analyst should have a wide range of knowledge about machine learning, database, programming languages, and visualization. For me, 3 most crucial skills any data analyst must have are solid background of mathematics, the ability to program software properly, and sensitivity. Mathematics skills are needed for machine learning, handling the raw data, and they could be helpful for learning new things. Moreover, data analysts sometimes need to develop their own application to retrieve and process data, so programming skills are highly-required. Sensitivity allows you to identify the right methods to deal with any kind of data, it could be developed through times and years of experiences in the job. At the moment, I am an undergraduate and I am aware that I still have a long way to meet those requirements. However, I am confident in my mathematics background and I can do a little bit of coding, so my plan is to study hard at RMIT firstly. During the course, I can strengthen my coding skills as well as mathematics knowledge. I think I will dig deep into linear algebra, probability, derivatives, integrals, machine learning, data mining, database: SQL, noSQL, some programming languages such as C/C++, Java, and then focus more on Python. Those are my objectives besides the lectures and tests in RMIT. After the graduation milestone, I would like to work for 2 or 3 years in the field for gaining job experiences, then I will aim for the master’s degree related to the wanted job. This is my plan for the upcoming 5 years, though it may be changed over time.</p>
