      <p>1. Viet’s Personal Information: My name is Nguyen Manh Quoc Viet and my student number is s3759306. I am Vietnamese, and I was born in Hanoi, Vietnam with my parents and my brother, but when they moved to Moscow, Russia, I was raised there, because their Vietnamese friends were living in Moscow. I didn’t have any education in Moscow, until me and my family went back to Vietnam, but in a different city, which was Ho Chi Minh city in 2004. In this city, I have enrolled in various random English schools to study English language, as well as enrolled in Russian school, in which I studied Russian language, as well as mathematics, English, Russian literature and Arts. After studying in Russian school, I was enrolled in Asia Pacific College School, but I didn’t like it there, since I don’t studied Vietnamese much in Vietnamese classes, because I have poor Vietnamese speaking skills. After that, I enrolled in Australian International School (AIS) in years 8 to 13, skipping year 7, since I have studied English at home with my English tutor. Finally, I have enrolled at RMIT University Vietnam. At first, I choose the engineering programs over IT programs, but after I have realized that the engineering programs were too difficult for me, I have switched to study IT programs, in which I became a Bachelor of IT. My hobby is playing piano when I have free time, because playing video games could waste my time and my energy, in which I could become more tired and want to sleep. In addition, they could fill my mind with video games, in which I will have less concentration when doing homework. I used to play video games, but now I stopped playing, because I have other important things to do and it destroys my restful sleep time. My interests in IT is that there are many devices that has unique features, such as smartphone’s touch screen device that allows users to touch any apps by using their fingers, the motion sensors at home could automatically turn on the lights when the person came home, a computers is able to read files when the disk has been inserted into it and internet offers many websites worldwide through wi-fi. My interest and experience in IT starts when I started using computer when I was a child and I could see many websites coming from the internet when I search them on Google and when I click their links in Google. In addition, there are many errors encountered when I opened a file that requires a suitable software to run it smoothly, such as when installing a Python and when inputting a code in PyCharm Community, in which they require updating my laptop’s software through sending my laptop to the computer engineers, so that they could update its software. </p>

      <p>Personal Profiles:</p>

    <body>
      <p>1. Viet’s Personal Profile: The results I got from 16Personalities, which was a Myers-Briggs test is that my personality type is Defender, in which I have introversion, sensing, feeling, judging, as well as thinking traits (ISFJ-T). This means that I am caring, helpful and organized person, in which I do the things I have planned in an organized way, as well as I am helping other people to fix their mistakes if they have done not right. Not only that, but I am caring to other people as I help them do their work. The results I got from TestMyCreativity website is that I have higher complexity, medium abstraction and boldness, low curiosity and perspective and lower persistence and paradox. This means that I have higher capability to carry lots of information, recreate them so that they could make sense even more and manage the relationships between them. Not only that, but I also have the capability to summarize various concepts from their original ideas. The results I got from Personality Max website is that I have higher strength of visual learning than auditory and kinesthetic learning. This means that I am good at remembering people’s faces after I have met them, although I sometimes forget their faces, because I haven’t met them again for a long time. In addition, I also could picture the things in my mind, in which when I see the objects and symbols many times, the pictures of them will form in my mind. These results could influence my behavior in a team, in which I was caring, selfless, organized and helpful person who plans which part each group member could do and when they are finished, they combine the parts together to complete a group work project. When doing the group work project, I read instructions carefully, so that I could know what to do and I have a good visual learning, in which I could see visual information clearly and precise, such as charts, graphs and diagrams. To take this into account when forming a team, I could ask them which group work project part that my group members could do and once they are finished, me and my group members will merge them together to make a complete group work project. In addition, me and my group members must read the instructions carefully and when seeing visual information, they need to see clearly their details and statistics, so that their information could be stored in our minds for paraphrasing them to be clearer. Not only that, but me and my group members must help each other when facing difficult problems and work together as a group, so that we could overcome these types of problems.</p>

      <p>Ideal Jobs:</p>

    <body>
      <p>1. Viet’s Ideal Job: AI Engineer is a job that involves describing and using the right Artificial Intelligence or cognitive computing technologies in order to fix the problems of the customers’ devices when they are not working and making AI recipes for development of the new technologies, as well as understanding the business problems, contemporary technologies’ challenges and areas of applying AI technologies. In addition, AI Engineer also involves making machine learning models and prototype device applications, AI platforms and AI projects by using made AI recipes. What makes this job appeals to me is that in the past, I have used both computers and phones, but haven’t checked out what are their unique features in them and how they were made, such as smartphone’s touch screen device, laptop’s motion sensor mouse, contemporary devices’ voice commands and search, smartphone’s keyboard that allows users to swipe letters into words through the use of a finger, laptop’s face recognition for automatic log in and contemporary devices’ changeable screen through tilting them into landscape form or into tablet form. In order to be an AI Engineer, I need to have at least 0.5 years of learning how to use one of Java, C, C++ or Python programming languages, study web application development as well as building API driven interface development. For the programming languages, I need to learn how us C++ for 4 years, Java for 2 years, Swift, C# .NET, SQL, JavaScript and HTML/CSS. The technologies I need to install include API, MVC, RealmSwift, Alamofire, Google Firebase, Java Web, Swing, Tomcat Web Server, JSTL, Struts and Json. In addition, I also need to install Visual Studio, Microsoft SQL Server, NetBeans, XCode, Postman, Git and Source Tree. I currently have typing skills, but I have poor coding skills, because I have focused too much on Engineering programs than IT programs when I am studying at RMIT University Vietnam and I study a little bit of IT when I was in AIS School, in which I have little IT skills. I also have mathematical skills, because I have studied mathematics at high school. I got a certificate in AIS School when I have finished Year 13 through successfully competing at least 3 courses. I have successfully completed English, Mathematical Studies and Psychology. I have studied algorithms and strings in Introduction to Programming and made strings and algorithms, but they don’t work properly, as I have poor coding skills, since I was still new to the IT community in RMIT University Vietnam. I will learn how to code properly and use various programming languages through studying Programming 1 in order to improve my coding skills, as well as learning how to make algorithms and strings in order to make them work properly.</p>
