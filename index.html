      <p>Viet’s Personal Information: My name is Nguyen Manh Quoc Viet and my student number is s3759306. I was born in Hanoi, Vietnam on 16th April 1999 with my parents and we moved to Moscow, Russia, because our friends were living in Moscow. In 2004, we moved to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and have lived permanently since. I didn’t have any education in Moscow, but I had education in various English schools in Ho Chi Minh City, in which I have studied English language. Then, I had enrolled in Russian school in order to improve my Russian language that I have learned when I was little in Moscow. After that, I went to Australian International School and studied in years 8 to 13. Finally, I enrolled in RMIT University Vietnam. Initially, I choose to do Engineering courses, but after I have found out that they were too difficult when choosing which courses to do in Semester 3, 2019, I have switched to study IT programs. My hobby is playing piano, as playing video games is detrimental to my health and sleep and they have wasted my time for planning to do important things. My interests is that there were many devices with unique features like touch screens, motion sensors at home, internet and computers able to read the files when the disk was inserted. My IT experiences began in the past when I started to use a computer at an early age, and I could see many websites in the Internet when searching them clicking and their links on Google. In addition, when I open a file that requires a suitable software to run, I encounter many errors that were occurred, such as when installing Python and when inputting a code in PyCharm Community, as they require updating my laptop’s software by sending it to computer engineers, so that they could update it.</p>

      <p>Thinh’s Personal Information: My name is Vu Gia Thinh and my student number is s3820373. I was born in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam on 3rd May 2000. In 2015, I have been enrolled in Le Hong Phong High School for the Gifted, one of the best high schools in Ho Chi Minh City. I have studied there in 3 years, in which I became fully equipped and well prepared as a grown-up person, because of this high school’s education quality.  After finishing high school, I have earned my scholarship at Kent Institute and I studied abroad in Australia in 2018. I studied nearly a year, but there was an incident that happened to my family, so I decided to go home and transfer my student record to Vietnam for continuing my bachelor’s degree. In 2019, when I send my study results to RMIT University Vietnam, they have accepted it and exempted some of my subjects. This is a place where I could continue by bachelor’s degree. I have a lot of hobbies, such as playing video games, playing soccer, reading books and watching movies. In addition, I also play musical instruments, such as guitar and electronic keyboard, but I am more confident in playing guitar and I play it in my free time.  My interests in IT is that I liked working with numbers, statistics and data when using computers. In addition, I was also interested in data analytics in computers. My IT experiences began when I had access to computer at the age of 4 or 5 and I liked to mess around with it, in which I kept digging the files and look for anything I want on the Internet. With a big curiosity, I have been thinking and wondered what makes the computer, who controls them and how do they work. I kept these questions until I was older and be able to understand the IT world.</p>

In addition, I could help other people to fix their mistakes and I am caring to other people, as I help them do their work.

In addition, I also have an ability to summarize various concepts from their original ideas.

      <p>Thinh’s Personal Profile: After taking the Myers-Briggs test, learning style test and big five personality test, I was not surprised at all. This is because I have figured out who I am already, however I did find them interesting for many new aspects that I could have. These tests could help me feel more certain about myself, so I could confidently develop as planned. These results are helpful to the group, as I would always watch what my group members do. If there is anything I know, I will focus more attention on their works and contribute my thoughts to them and if I don’t understand about the unknown topics, I will simply just watch and learn. I am very open to ideas and I only conduct them if the benefits outweigh the risks, as I am not a risk taker. I want to play safe and steady within a team.</p>

      <p>Khang’s Personal Profile: After finishing the Myers-Briggs test, the learning style test and creativity test, I have realized that all three tests were mostly correct in describing me. However, the don’t show me what kind of persona I am. I know that I have better kinesthetic learning than visual learning and most importantly I was way worse compared to how these three tests describe me. These three tests will not be beneficial when working in a group, as I will have a hard time to co-operate with my teammates and as a team member, I will not be able to share my ideas to other group members because of my shyness. The best solution to overcome this problem is to build a team with people that I already knew well, especially people who could share their thoughts without being shy and having pressured me, until I give a response to the question at hand.</p>

      <p>All three of us have different ideas for our group project in Assignment 1, however, we decided that those options are not suitable to do, because we are a bit tight on time. In addition, we do not have enough time to make a JRPG game and a troubleshooting app is way out of our league. After discussing with each other about possible ideas, we came to the conclusion that we will make a quiz app for educational purposes using MIT App Inventor 2.
We are planning to compose around 20 questions to put in the app. Our intention is to provide users knowledge on interesting facts that they might not know. The questions will cover all topics such as mathematics, literature, geography, music, etc. This quiz not only covers just international information, but also covers questions about Vietnamese culture and history to help the users have a general grasp of Vietnam. The users will answer each question on a single page, then move to the next page for the following quiz. Different types of questions will be added, for example, yes/no question, multiple-choice, text input quiz, and for the geography topics, the users have to drag and point the exact position required on the map. The app has a scoring system to grade the marks when users have answered all the questions. After each question answered, a notification system will notice the player whether if they were right or wrong. If they choose/provide the correct answer, a tick will appear, on the other hand, a cross will pop up if the player is wrong. 
As mentioned before, the tool we are going to use to make this app called MIT App Inventor 2, an open-source, cloud-based service that allows you to create a mobile app on your own using a block-based programming language. You can access MIT App Inventor 2 with a browser such as Chrome, Firefox or Safari for iOS devices and start coding directly on the browser with no other IDEs required. For testing and debugging, an Android mobile phone or tablet is recommended since it can sync with your code in real-time and you can check if the app is running well or not. 
The challenge for us is to get familiar with the tool because this is our first-time using MIT App Inventor 2. Luckily, we know basic concepts about programming and some of us know how to code on different languages, so we do not have much to worry about this. A more concerned problem is how to work efficiently as a group that each member is assigned suitable tasks and the coding must be clear so that everyone can view and understand them. This is a group work, so mutual understandings must be achieved between everyone. 
Once everything is done, our product can be uploaded on CH Play and it can operate well on all Android devices. However, iOS devices are not supported, because MIT App Inventor 2 is only supported on Android platform, which is a huge drawback. We hope to bring joyful moments as well as interesting new information for users when they answer the questions in the app.</p>
